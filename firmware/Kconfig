# Rangefinder BLE Configuration

config RANGE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS
	int "Range sensor sampling interval in milliseconds"
	default 50
	help
	  How often to read from the VL53L0X sensor.
	  50ms = 20Hz update rate. Lower values increase responsiveness
	  but consume more power.

config RANGE_NOTIFY_INTERVAL_MS
	int "BLE notification interval in milliseconds"
	default 50
	help
	  How often to send BLE notifications to the central.
	  Should be >= RANGE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS.

config BATTERY_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S
	int "Battery level sampling interval in seconds"
	default 60
	help
	  How often to read the battery ADC.
